### Organize and Move Files by Type & Date

A straightforward script to help organize and move files from a source directory to a destination directory. This script categorizes files into types (e.g., Images) and organizes them into date-based subfolders based on the last modified date. It is designed to be simple and efficient, with real-time feedback.

---

## Key Features
- **File Type Organization**: Automatically sorts files into predefined categories (e.g., "Images", "Unsorted").
- **Date-Based Subfolders**: Files are further organized into subfolders based on their last modified date, e.g., `YYYYMM_MonthName/YYY-MM-DD`.
- **Duplicate Handling**: Skips moving files that already exist in the destination directory.
- **Dry Run Mode**: Simulates the process without making any changes.
- **Progress Bar**: Displays real-time progress.

## How to Use

### 1. Install Requirements
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the required package:

```bash
pip install tqdm
```

### 2. Run the Script
Run the script with the following command:

```bash
python photobook_image_sorter.py /path/to/source /path/to/destination
```

- Replace `/path/to/source` with the folder containing files you want to organize.
- Replace `/path/to/destination` with the folder where files will be organized.

### Optional: Dry Run
To simulate the process without moving files, add the `--dry-run` flag:

```bash
python photobook_image_sorter.py /path/to/source /path/to/destination --dry-run
```

## Example Output Structure
After running the script, your destination directory will be organized as follows:

```
/destination
    /Images
        /202412_December
            /2024-12-28
                file1.jpg
                file2.png
    /Unsorted_Files
        /TXT
            notes.txt
        /Unknown
            somefile
```

---

## Notes
1. **Supported File Types**: Currently, only image files (`.jpg`, `.png`, etc.) are categorized under "Images". Other files are placed in the "Unsorted_Files" folder.
2. **Hidden Files**: Files starting with a dot (`.`) are skipped by default.
3. **Logging**: Logs are saved in the destination directory with a timestamp, e.g., `log_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`.
4. **Error Handling**: The script creates missing directories and gracefully handles duplicates.
