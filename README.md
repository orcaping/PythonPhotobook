# üìÅ Organize and Move Files by Type & Date

A powerful script to help you organize and move files from a source directory to a destination directory. This script categorizes files into types (e.g., Images, Videos, Others) and further organizes them into date-based subfolders based on the creation date of each file. It supports various file types, including common image and video formats, and provides real-time feedback with a progress bar.

## üåü Key Features
- **File Type Organization**: Automatically categorizes files into folders like "Images", "Videos", and "Others" based on file extensions.
- **Date-Based Subfolder Creation**: Each file is sorted into subfolders by its creation date (formatted as `YYMM_MonthName`, e.g., `2409_September`).
- **Duplicate Handling**: Automatically skips moving files that already exist in the destination, avoiding duplicate content.
- **Real-Time Progress Bar**: Provides a visual representation of file transfer progress using `tqdm`.
- **Extensible & Customizable**: Easily modify the file types and date format according to your needs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Instructions

### 1. **Install Requirements**
Ensure that you have the required Python packages installed. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install tqdm
```

### 2. **Running the Script**

To use the script, simply define the source and destination directories and call the `organize_and_move_files()` function:

```python
source_directory = '/path/to/source/folder'
destination_directory = '/path/to/destination/folder'

organize_and_move_files(source_directory, destination_directory)
```

The script will automatically categorize the files in your source folder, organize them by their creation date, and move them into appropriately structured folders in the destination directory.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

The script is designed to be flexible and easily customizable. Below are the different parameters and sections of the code you can modify according to your preferences:

### 1. **File Extensions**
The script categorizes files into three groups: Images, Videos, and Others. You can modify or add new extensions in the following part of the code:

```python
image_extensions = ['.jpg', '.png', '.gif', '.bmp', '.jpeg', '.HEIC', '.heic', '.WEBP']
video_extensions = ['.mov', '.mp4']
other_extensions = ['.json']
```

- **Add New File Types**: If you'd like to categorize additional file types, simply add more extensions to the appropriate list.
- **Create New Categories**: You can also create new categories, such as "Documents" or "Audio", by adding more entries to the `file_categories` dictionary.

### 2. **Date-Based Organization**
Files are placed into subfolders named according to their creation date, using the format `YYMM_MonthName`. You can adjust this date format:

```python
date_based_folder = created_time.strftime('%y%m_%B')  # YYMM_MonthName format
```

- For example, to format dates as `YYYY_MM_Day`, modify the string to:
  ```python
  date_based_folder = created_time.strftime('%Y_%m_%d')
  ```

### 3. **Progress Bar**
The script uses `tqdm` to display a progress bar during the file-moving process. If you'd like to adjust the progress bar or remove it, you can modify this section of the code:

```python
progress_bar = tqdm(total=total_files, desc="Moving files")
```

### 4. **Source and Destination Directories**
You can change the paths for the source and destination directories in the script, or pass them dynamically as arguments.

### 5. **Duplicate File Handling**
By default, the script checks if a file already exists in the destination and skips it if a duplicate is found. You can change this behavior by adjusting this section of the code:

```python
if os.path.exists(dest_path):
    print(f"Duplicate exists, skipping: {file}")
    continue
```

## üìÇ Directory Structure

After running the script, the destination directory will be organized as follows:

```
/Destination
    /Images
        /2409_September
            image1.jpg
            image2.png
    /Videos
        /2409_September
            video1.mp4
    /Others
        /2409_September
            config.json
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling
The script is designed to handle common errors like:
- **File Already Exists**: Skips duplicates to prevent overwriting.
- **Directory Not Found**: Automatically creates missing directories in the destination.
- **Unsupported Extensions**: Files with unsupported extensions are ignored unless new categories are defined.
